# Bugfree [![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0)

This is the repository for my personal website [Bugfree](http://www.bugfree.fi). It is running on Node.js/Express and uses Pug template language. It uses PostgreSQL as the database management system.

## Roadmap

These are the features I'm planning to implement (in no order of importance):

- simple CMS for publishing articles or blog entries
- automatic deployment using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)
- automated testing with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org)
- separate frontend implemented in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)
- improved repository structure
